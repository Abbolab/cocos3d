Installation
------------

The cocos3d framework is built on cocos2d 1.x. Before installing cocos3d,
you must download and install the cocos2d 1.x SDK from:

http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/download

*** PLEASE NOTE THAT cocos3d 0.7.2 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH cocos2d 2.x. ***
***     BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD cocos2d 1.x FOR USE WITH cocos3d.          ***

Unzip the cocos3d distribution file (which you've probably already done,
otherwise you wouldn't be reading this document).

Open a Terminal session, navigate to the unzipped cocos3d distribution
directory and run the install-cocos3d script as follows:

./install-cocos3d.sh -f -2 "path-to-cocos2d-sources"

For example:

./install-cocos3d.sh -f -2 "../../cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone-1.1"

The cocos2d source code must be available and identified using the -2 switch so that the
installer can link the cocos2d libraries to the cocos3d templates and demo projects.

If you encounter 'rsync' errors during installation, it's typically because you are trying
to run the installer without first navigating to the cocos3d distribution directory.
Be sure to run the installer from the cocos3d distribution directory.

That's it!


cocos2d Version Compatibility
-----------------------------

*** PLEASE NOTE THAT cocos3d 0.7.2 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH cocos2d 2.x. ***

cocos3d 0.7.2 is compatible with all cocos2d 1.x versions.

At the time of this release, the current version of cocos2d is 1.1, and by default, cocos3d is
configured to use that version.


GCC 4.2 Compiler Warnings
-------------------------

cocos3d can be compiled by either Apple's recommended 'Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1' (aka Clang),
or the older 'LLVM GCC 4.2' compiler. However, the 'LLVM GCC 4.2' compiler will generate a
number of deprecation warnings about the deprecated cocos3d class CC3TargettingNode.

To remove these warnings, we recommend moving to the 'Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1' compiler.
If that is not possible, you can remove these warnings by removing any dependency in your
code on the CC3TargettingNode and CC3World classes, and then removing the 'deprecated'
group from your project in Xcode.


Creating Your First cocos3d Project
-----------------------------------

To get started with your first cocos3d project, open Xcode 4, click on the
File->New->NewProject... menu selection, and select the 'cocos3d Application'
project template from the cocos3d template group.

The template project starts with a working 3D variation on the familiar 'hello, world'
application, and you can use it as a starting point for your own application.


Documentation
-------------

The cocos3d Programming Guide is online at:

	http://brenwill.com/2011/cocos3d-programming-guide/.

The API documentation is online at:

	http://brenwill.com/docs/cocos3d/0.7.2/api/

You can create a local copy of the API documentation using Doxygen to extract the
documentation from the source files. There is a Doxygen configuration file to output
the API documents in the same format as appears online in the folder Docs/API within
the cocos3d distribution.


Demo Applications
-----------------

The best way to understand what cocos3d can do is to look at the examples and code
in the demo applications that are included in the cocos3d distribution. These demos,
particularly the CC3DemoMashUp app, will help you understand how to use cocos3d,
and demonstrate many of the key features and capabilities of cocos3d.

For convenience, to access all of the demos together, open the 'cocos3d.xcworkspace'
Xcode workspace. You can also open each demo project individually in the Demos folder.

The following demo apps are included in the cocos3d distribution:


   CC3DemoMashUp
   -------------

   Please read the class notes of the CC3DemoMashUpScene class for a full description of how to
   run and interact with this demo, and what features it covers.

   Your camera hovers over a scene that includes animated robots, bouncing beach-balls,
   spinning globes, and a selection of animated teapots. This is a sophisticated demo that
   showcases many interesting features of cocos3d, including:

   In addition, there are a number of interesting options for you to play with by uncommenting
   certain lines of code in the methods of this class that build objects in the 3D scene,
   including experimenting with:
     - simple particle generator with multi-colored, light-interactive, particles
     - simple particle generator with meshes updated less frequently to conserve performance 
     - different options for ordering nodes when drawing, including ordering by mesh or texture
     - configuring the camera for parallel/isometric/orthographic projection instead of the default
       perpective projection
     - mounting the camera on a moving object, in this case a bouncing ball
     - mounting the camera on a moving object, in this case a bouncing ball, and having the
       camera stay focused on the rainbow teapot as both beach ball and teapot move and rotate
     - directing an object to track another object, always facing that object, but only
       rotating in one direction (eg- side-to-side, but not up and down).

     - making use of a fixed bounding volume for the 3D particle emitter to improve performance.
     - permitting a node to cast a shadow even when the node itself is invisible by using the shouldCastShadowsWhenInvisible property


   CC3Demo3DTiles
   --------------

   A simple demo that lays out multiple small cocos3d scenes as layers in a larger cocos2d
   layer. The effect is a grid of tiles, with each tile displaying a separate 3D scene,
   each containing its own camera and lighting. The main node in each 3D tile can be rotated
   under touch control.

   This demonstrates the ability to simply include 3D objects in an otherwise 2D game,
   and techniques for optimizing under those conditions. It also demonstrates touch control
   when many 3D scene are visible concurrently, and the ability to add app data to nodes
   using the userData property.

   The CC3Demo3DTiles demo app also demonstrates the use of the cocos2d RootController with cocos3d.


   CC3Performance
   --------------

   This is a simple demo of the performance characteristics of cocos3d. It demonstrates
   how to collect statistics about your application's performance. In doing so, it
   presents a number of model scenarios, and through the user interface, you can control
   the type of model loaded and how many copies to render.

   You can dynamically experiment with how different model types, sizes and quantities
   affects the performance of cocos3d. You can also use this performance demo app to
   compare performance across different device types.


Demo Models
-----------

Some of the POD models that appear in the demo and template apps were designed in Blender,
exported to DAE, and converted to POD files using the PowerVR Collada2POD converter.

As a reference for the creation of your own 3D models for use in cocos3d, you can find
the original Blender files and DAE files for these POD models in the Models folder in
the cocos3d distribution.


Creating POD 3D Model Files
---------------------------

cocos3d reads 3D model content from POD files. If you are using a 3D editor, you can export
your 3D model to a file in COLLADA 1.4 format, and then convert the COLLADA file to the POD
format read by cocos3d.

To convert COLLADA files to POD files, you can use the Collada2POD converter tool available
in the PowerVR SDK, which is available free from Imagination Technologies, the supplier of
the GPU's used in iOS devices.

Full instructions on where to get the Collada2POD converter, and how to use it to convert
COLLADA files to POD files, can be found at:

http://brenwill.com/2011/cocos3d-importing-converting-collada-to-pod/


PowerVR Library
---------------

In order to reduce the size of the cocos3d distribution, several large and
unused files have been removed from the PVR library. More info can be found
in the document: 'cocos3d/cc3PVR/PVRT 2.10/PVRT_Removed_Files.txt'.
